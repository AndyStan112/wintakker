This repository contains a cli for playing TAK with either:

1. yourself in manual mode
2. an alphabeta bot with static evaluation
3. an alphabeta bot with dynamic ML evaluation

The data used to train the ml came from the public playtack.com games database that stores all games played on that website, which is exposed under an MIT license. The games.db file in this repository is a snapshot of that database taken on the 13th of January 2026 and does not belong to me!
